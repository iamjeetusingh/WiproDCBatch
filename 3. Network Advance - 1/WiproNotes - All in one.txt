OSI model
-----------
- Open System Interconnect
- its a refference model
- this model contains 7 layers in it.
	- Physical layer
	- Data Link layer		--> Switches work here
	- Network layer			--> Router works here, L3 switches
	- Transport layer
	- session layer
	- presentation layer
	- application layer
	
NAT 
	- Network Address Translation
	- translating Private IP address to Public IP address.
	
Speed ---> IOPS (Input Output Per Sec)
	HDD 
		- 150 IOPS
		- slower than SSD
		- cheaper than SSD
	SSD 
		- 1.5 Million IOPS
		- faster than HDD
		- Costlier than HDD
		

Containerization:
------------------
- 2-3 sec to restart/power-on
- self-heal


Cloud:
------
- Pay as you go
- cloud is renting the services (compute, network, storage, etc) over the internet
- SLA = Service Level Agreement

Cloud Deployment Models:
	- Public Cloud
		- any one can access
	- Private cloud
		- for people within organization
	- Hybrid cloud
		- combo public + private cloud
		
Cloud / Vendor / Cloud Vendor:
	1. AWS (Amazon Web Service)
	2. Microsoft Azure				--> https://portal.azure.com/
	3. GCP (Google Cloud Platform)
	
Ques - how much amount (approx), I need to pay to run 30 VMs each of 8GB RAM, for 1 month?

BYOL - Bring Your Own Lic



Software for networking:
-----------------------
	- Cisco Packet Tracer
	- GNS3 (Graphical Network Simulator)
	
	
	hub		-> dumb
	switch	-> intelligent 
	
ARP
	- Address Resolution Protocol
	
switch maintains MAC/CAM table

Routing protocol
- OSPF	-> unlimited routers
- RIP	-> 15+1 = 16


ipconfig /release		--> release old IP address
ipconfig /renew			--> get a new IP address

Ques - How an IP is assigned to a computer?
-------------------------------------------
- 3 ways to assign an IP to a computer
	1. Manual (static IP)
		- admin needs to assign IP manually to all the PCs.
		- good for limited number of computers.
		
	2. Automatic 
		- no human intervention is required.
		- automatically IP will be assigned to the system.
		- it is possible because of 
			- DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
			- DHCP works on port 67,68
			- DHCP works on Client-Server architecture.
			- DHCP uses "DORA" process
				D = Discover
				O = Offer
				R = Request
				A = Acknowledgement
					
	3. APIPA
		- Automatic Private IP Addressing
		- when DHCP server is unable to give the IP address, bcoz of:
			1. DHCP server is inactive
			2. DHCP scope is full
		- in this case, client automatically allocates a "specific IP" range to itself. called as APIPA.
		- specific IP range (169.254.X.X) - 169.254.1.1 - 169.254.255.255 
		- with this APIPA address, you cannot communicate with any machine within the network.
		- with this APIPA address, you cannot ping another computer
		- with this APIPA address, you cannot share any data on the network
		- APIPA can be resolved
			1. ensure DHCP server is working fine.
			2. ensure DHCP server has enough IP addresses in scope.
			3. release the IP 	-> ipconfig /release
			4. renew the IP 	-> ipconfig /renew
			5. if nothing works out, set the IP MANUALLY.
			


Private IP address
	- are usable within LAN, close areas

Public IP address
	- are usable on internet, WAN

Reserved IP addresses/ranges:
------------------------
	0.0.0.0 						--> network ID
	169.254.0.1 - 169.254.255.255	--> APIPA
	224.0.0.0 - 239.255.255.255		--> Multicast group
	240.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.254		--> experimental usage
	255.255.255.255					--> broadcast IP address

we use these for internal/private usage:
	10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255		--> Class A Private IP address
	172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255		--> Class B Private IP address
	192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255	--> Class C Private IP address
	
subnetting
	- Breaking down a bigger network into smaller networks is called SUBNET.
	- subnetting is used for minimizing the IP wastage.
	
supernetting
	- it is opposite of subnetting
	- smaller networks are merged together to make a bigger network.
	- it is useful in managing the network
	
Google's public DNS address
	- 8.8.8.8
	- 8.8.4.4

Subnet mask 
	- is a 32 bit number 
	- it helps in determining the
		1. network 
		2. hosts
	- types:
		1. fixed length subnet mask (FLSM)
			- all the subets will have same subnet mask.
			- this leads to the wastage of IP addresses.
		
		2. variable length subnet mask (VLSM)
			- all the subnets that uses VLSM, will have variable lengths.
			- thus, minimizing the IP wastage.
			

to est. comm. between 2 computers - 192.168.10.0/24 :
-----------------------------------
go to 1st PC:
	- IP address	: 192.168.10.1
	- Subnet Mask	: 255.255.255.0
	
go to 2nd PC:
	- IP address	: 192.168.10.2
	- Subnet Mask	: 255.255.255.0
