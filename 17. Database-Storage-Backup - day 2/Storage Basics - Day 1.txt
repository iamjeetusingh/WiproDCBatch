Storage Basics:
-----------------
- storing data digitally.
- 3 keywords:
	- availability
	- integrity
	- security
- types of storage:
	- Primary storage
		- RAM
		- Cache
	- Secondary storage
		- HDD
		- SSD
		- NVMe
	- long-term storage
		- tape drives
		- CD/DVD
		- Blu-rays
	- cloud storage
		- AWS 		- S3 bucket
		- Azure 	- Azure stroage account
		- Google 	- Google cloud storage
Storage Architecture:
----------------------
	1. Direct Attached Storage (DAS)
		- it will be connected directly to the server/machine
		- using a small, single cable.
		- ex:
			- external HDD
			- external SSD
			- Pendrives
		- scability is the issue
		
	2. Network-Attached Storage (NAS)
		- dedicated storage within the network
		- uses file-based storage
			- NFS
				- Network File Share
				- used for transferring data between linux to linux & windows to windows
					L <--> L
					W <--> W
			- SMB
				- Samba server
				- mostly used in cloud technologies
				- current version: 4.0
				- cross platform
					- L <--> W
					- W <--> L
					- L <--> L
			- CIFS
				- common internet file system
		- easy to manage & share the data 
		- performance is not good within a network.
		
	3. Storage Area Network (SAN)
		- high speed, good performance storage designed for production
		- it uses block level storage	
			- iSCSI
			- Fiber channel
		- it is scable, supports virtualization
		- Expensive & complex
		- components of SAN
			1. storage devices
			2. server
			3. networking hardware
			4. software
		- it works on MPIO (MultiPath Input Output)
		- 3 types of SANs:
			1. Fibre Channel 
			2. IP SAN	(iSCSI)
			3. Hybrid SAN

Storage virtualization:
------------------------
	- logical instance of physical stroage to improve manageability
	- technologies:
		- VMWare vSAN
		- Microsoft Storage Spaces
		- Linux LVM (Logical Volume Manager)

RAID:
------
	- performance & redundancy
	- different levels:
		- RAID 0	
			- works on Striping
			- useful in storing data faster
			- no fault tolerence
		- RAID 1
			- works on mirroring concept.
			- has fault tolerence.
			- we are using only 50% of actual disk.
		- RAID 5
			- works on striping with parity
			- used for higher redundancy
			- even if one disk crashes, we can still recover the crashed disk information
			- Minimum 3 disks of equal sizes are required.
		- RAID 6 
			- works on striping with dual parity
			- used for high redundancy
			- minimum 4 disks are required
		- RAID 10
			- Mirroring (RAID 1) + Striping (RAID 0)
			- used for high speed & redundancy
			- its n expensive solution
			
Storage Protocols:
-------------------
	- Fiber Channel (FC)
		- high speed network, used in SAN 
	- iSCSI
		- Internet Small Computer System Interface
		- used in TCP/IP for storage 
	- NFS
		- used in Linux/Unix/Windows
	- SMB
		- Server Message Block
		- used in windows infra.
		- used in multi-platform network.
	- NVMe-oF
		- NVMe Over Fabrics
		- high performance protocol for remote flash storage
		
Storage spaces in Windows:
-----------------------------
	- Simple spaces
		- simple, used for high performance storage
		- minimum 2 disks are required
	- Mirror spaces
		- used for high performance
		- this uses mirroring concept
		- it uses by default ReFS 
		- 2 types:
			1. 2-way mirror
				- stores 2 copies of ur data
			2. 3-way mirror
				- stores 3 copies of ur data
	- Parity spaces:
		- storing parity
		- minimum of 3 disks are required
		
		
TasK:
-------
- on DC, create a user with your last name & with full admin level permissions. create a folder name "resources" in c drive & give read & write access to only your user. 
- access resources folder on client machine with your credentials and verify if its working or not.
