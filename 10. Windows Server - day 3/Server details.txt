Roles
------
	- are made up of role services components that provide additional functionality associated with the role.
	- we need to install the role(s), in order to get the appro. services.

	- Remote access
	- Remote desktop service (RDS)
	
Features:
------------
	- independent components that supports the "Roles" in thier working.
	- are the backbone for the roles.
	- list of features:
		- DotNet 3.5 Framework
		- DotNet 4.5 Framework
		- Bitlocker
		- BITS

Server Manager: (Server Manager Dashboard Page)
----------------
	- is a graphical tool for managing local or remote computers in windows servers
	- what we can do?
		- install/uninstall roles
		- install/uninstall features
		- manage local machine
			- computer name
			- IP address
			- Firewall
			- Clock
		- manage remote computers

Administrative tools:
----------------------
	- Active Directory Administrative Center
	- Active Directory Users & Computers
	- DNS Console
	- Event Viewer
	- Performance Monitor
	- Task Schedular
	- IIS Manager
	- GPMC (Group Policy Management Console)
	
Installation methods:
----------------------
	1. Optical Disk (DVD)
	2. WDS (Windows Deployment Service) - Network boot
	3. USB Media (pendrive)

Windows Active Directory (WAD): or Active Directory (AD)
---------------------------------------------------------
	- is a directory service developed by Microsoft. 
	- linux version of AD is called "LDAP" (Light Weight Directory Access Protocol)
	- it stores all the information like
		- Users
		- Groups
		- Computers
	- it perform 2As
		- Authentication (verify your identity)
		- Authorization  (Granting Permissions)
	- you can manage & control resources
		- network resources
		- Policies
		- User accounts & what they access.
	- to get the AD within your organization, we need to install "ADDS" (Active Directory Domain Service) role on windows server.

Terms used in Active Directory (AD) concept:
--------------------------------------------
Domain
	- logical boundary for administrative purpose.
	- it is a collection of objects
		- users
		- computers
		- groups
	- all the objects shares the same database
		- Name of the domain database is "NTDS.DIT"
			- "New Technology Directory Service.directory"
		- this database is stored with the AD domain.
	- domain is represented as a TRIANGLE.
	
Tree
	- hierarchy of domains with the root domain.
	
Forest
	- collection of AD trees.
	- it shares a common schema (blueprint) & global catalog (indexing)

Schema
	- its the blueprint
	- defines the types of objects created in the directory.

Global catalog
	- a searchable index
	- we search for the objects with the help of GC server.

OU (Organizational Unit)
	- its like a department
	- these are like containers within a domain that holds
		- users
		- computers
		- groups
Site
	- Physical, Geo-Graphical location within domain
	- it contains multiple OUs in it.

Group Policy
	- its a policy that is applied to manage the domain & its objects.
	- its a centrailzed policy to manage
		- users
		- computers
		- permissions
		- security
	- to create, manage & delete a policy we need GPMC (Group Policy Management Console)
	- group policies are applied on OUs.
	
Group Policy hierarchical structure:
	- local group policy
		- this policy is applied on local computer only & impacts only on your computer.
	- site-level group policy
		- these policies are applied on the SITE level.
		- all the computers within specific site are applied with this policy.
	- Domain level group policy
		- domain policies are applied to all users and computers within that domain.
	- Organizational Unit (OU) level group policies
		- these policies are applied onto the whole OU.

Components of an Active Directory (AD)
---------------------------------------
	1. Physical Component
		- Domain Controller (DC)
			- it contains the copy of AD database (NTDS.dit)
		- Data Store
			- the file on each domain controller that stores the AD information.
		- Global Catalog (GC) Server
			- its a server that hosts the read-only copy of all objects within domain for faster search.
		- Read-Only Domain Controller (RODC)
			- its a special type (read-only) of domain controller.
			- this RODC is often used in branch offices.
	
	2. Logical Component
		- Partition
			- its the logical seperation within the NTDS.dit database
			- aka naming contexts
		- Schema
		- Domain
		- Domain Tree
		- Forest
		- Site
		- OU
		
AD DS logon process:
------------------
	1. user provided username & password and it gets authenticated by DC.
	2. DC returns the TGT (Ticket Granting Token).
	3. using this TGT, client applies to login to SVR using WS.
	4. client is then allowed to login to the SVR using the TGT.
	

types of DCs
	1. Domain Controller (DC)
	2. Additional Domain Controller (ADC)
	3. Backup domain controller (BDC)
	4. Read-Only Domain Controller (RODC)
	5. Primary Domain Controller (PDC)

Operations Master:
-------------------
	- aka FSMO (Flexible Single Master Operation)
	- these are the special domain controller tasks/roles
	- 5 types of FSMO roles, that are applied on forest-level & Domain level
	- Roles in FSMO
		1. Forest 
			a. Domain Naming Master
				- checks for the name
			b. Schema Master
				- checks for the blueprint
		2. Domain
			c. RID (Relative IDentifier) master
				- this allocates the blocks of RIDs to different domain controllers within the domain.
					- whenever an object (user, computer or group) is created within a domain env, a unique SID (Security IDentifier) is allocated to this object.
				- the job of RID is to ensure that no 2 objects have same SID.
				- a set of total 500 RIDs are allocated in domain level, at once.
					- SID
						"S-1-5-21-1341496841-55697840-1495310029-1001"
							-> "S-1-5-21" - type of ID
							-> "1341496841-55697840-1495310029" - where the account is stored
							-> "1001" - is RID
			d. PDC (Primary Domain Controller) Emulator
				- it provides the back compatibility with old system
				- it handles the "password change" & account lockouts.
				- it also checks the time on every system within the domain.
				- Every domain has only ONE PDC Emulator.
			e. Infrastructure Master
				- this manages references to the objects in other domain.
				- it is used for cross-domain object reference.
				
				
Task:
======
first finish below tasks
	1. Installation of windows server 2016 completed 
	2. VMWare tools Installation completed 
	3. power off the windows server 2016 (that u just installed)
	4. install another VM, with windows server 2016 datacenter (CORE) edition

THE MOST IMP THING:
===========================
REVISE ALL THE TOPICS, THAT WE STUDIED TILL NOW.
:)

Post installation configuration  -->  Server Manager Dashboard Page:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
- here, we perform several tasks just after the installation is completed
- tasks like:
	- to set IP address
	- to change the time & time zone
	- configure firewall
	- to change the IE configuration settings
	- to change the remote management settings
	- to change the computer name
	
Converting server machine into a DOMAIN CONTROLLER (DC):
--------------------------------------------------------
	1. Install a windows server OS (2016)
	2. Perform post installation configuration
	3. Install ADDS role on this server
		- GUI -> server manager to install this role.
		- CLI -> powershell to install this role.
	4. promote your machine from server to domain controller.
	5. restart this machine & login as domain administrator.
		normal	-> administrator
		domain	-> domain_name\administrator

Note: when you install & promote your machine to DC using ADDS role, DNS role automatically gets installed. 

Domain Joining:
-----------------
	- add a client/server operating system to the domain controller.
	- so that the client/server os can be controlled by DC.
	- so that client/server machine can be applied with the group policies.
	- so that a user that got created on DC can login into this machine.
	
requirements for domain joining:
	- both DC and client must be power on
	- both machines must have the same LAN SEGMENT (windows)
	- both machines should be in same network
		DC 		
			IP = 192.168.10.10
			SM = 255.255.255.0
			GW = 127.0.0.1
		client 	
			IP = 192.168.10.11
			SM = 255.255.255.0
			GW = 192.168.10.10
		   DNS = 192.168.10.10
		   
to domain join a windows server OS
	- install the server os
	- perform post installation configuration
	- doin join it.
	
PS Cmdlet to create a new OU:
New-ADOrganizationalUnit -Name WiproDCb42 -ProtectedFromAccidentalDeletion $false
New-ADOrganizationalUnit -Name demoOU -ProtectedFromAccidentalDeletion $false
 
File systems supported in Windows Server:
	- FAT		(File Allocation Table)			-->  Old
	- FAT32										-->  Old, Pendrives
	- NTFS		(New Technology File System)	-->  Default file system
	- ReFS		(Resilient File System)

Ques: Difference between FAT32 & NTFS files system?

run -> diskmgmt.msc

DNS Records:
--------------
- entries of a device
- types
	- A		=  	IPv4 address (www.google.com -> 1.1.1.1)
	- AAAA	=	IPv6 address
	- MX	= 	Mail Exchange
	- SOA	= 	Start of Authority
	- PRT	= 	Pointer


password requirements:
	- minimum 8 chars
	- 1 cap 
	- 1 small
	- 1 special chars
	- 1 number
	
DNS records:
-------------
- A record	-> 	IPv4 address
	www.google.com   <---->   116.115.114.113
	
- AAAA record	-> 	IPv6 address
	www.google.com   <---->   2404:6800:4009:823::200e
	
- CNAME record (Canonical name / Alias name)
	www.facebook.com   <---->   fb.com 
	
- PTR record (pointer)
	IP    >>   Name
	
- SOA record (Start of Authority)

DNS Zones:
------------
1. Forward lookup Zone
	- used for resolving names into IP address.
		www.google.com   ---->   116.115.114.113
	- there are records that are releated to FLZ:
		- A record
		- AAAA record
		- CNAME record

2. Reverse lookup Zone
	- used to resolve IP back to name 
		116.115.114.113     ---->   www.google.com
	- PTR record is related to RLZ.
	
SVR name
	blr.dc.training.in		--> FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name)
	
For viewing the events in powershell:
Get-EventLog -LogName Application -Newest 5 | Format-Table -AutoSize -Wrap


Disks:
	1. Static / Basic Disk
		- it's a fixed disk.
		- where size of the disk can't be changed.
	2. Dynamic disk
		- where size of the disk can be increased or decreased as per requirements.
		- dynamic disks are of 3 types:
			1. Striped disk
				- in this, data is distributed across multiple disks.
			2. Mirrored disk
				- in this disk, data get duplicated across different disks.
			3. Spanned disk
				- in this, multiple disks of different sizes can be add into one single disk.
				
Windows Server Backup:
----------------------
	- 3rd party tools (free tools & paid tools)
	- Windows server backup	(WSB) tool


Types of backups:
--------------------
	1. Full backup
		- it backs up whole/full system, which includes
			- system state
			- applications installed
			- its data.
		- it requires more storage space.
		- it can recover whole machine or a specific file when needed.
	2. Incremental backup
		- backs up only the changes made since last backup (full or incremental).
		- it requires less storage
		- it is faster than full backup
		- for restoring a file, it requires full backup & incremental backup in a sequence.
	3. Differential backup:
		- it backs up all the changes made since the last FULL BACKUP.
		- it takes more space than incremental backup
		- but it can restore files & folder faster than incremental backup.
	4. System state backup
		- it backs up only the critical components	
			- active directory
			- registry
			- boot files
			- system files
	5. file & folder backup
		- it backs up selected files & folders instead of full disk.
	6. bare-Metal backup (BMR - bare matel recovery)
		- it creates a full backup of the server, allowing you to restore everything inclusing OS or partitions on same or different hardware.
		
list of backup tools:
----------------------
1. Windows Server Backup (WSB)
	- built-in tool
2. System Center Data Protection Manager (DPM)
	- enterprise backup solution
3. Azure backup
