session
-----------
- server
- storage
- network

Domain Controller
- Authorization
- Authentication

data center
- server
- storage
- network
	- firewall
	- routers
	- switches
	- cables
- racks

Hypervisor
- a tool to achieve virtualization
- types
	- type 1
	- type 2

OSI model
-----------
- Open System Interconnect
- its a refference model
- this model contains 7 layers in it.
	- Physical layer
	- Data Link layer		--> Switches work here
	- Network layer			--> Router works here, L3 switches
	- Transport layer
	- session layer
	- presentation layer
	- application layer
	
NAT 
	- Network Address Translation
	- translating Private IP address to Public IP address.
	
Speed ---> IOPS (Input Output Per Sec)
	HDD 
		- 150 IOPS
		- slower than SSD
		- cheaper than SSD
	SSD 
		- 1.5 Million IOPS
		- faster than HDD
		- Costlier than HDD
		

Containerization:
------------------
- 2-3 sec to restart/power-on
- self-heal


Cloud:
------
- Pay as you go
- cloud is renting the services (compute, network, storage, etc) over the internet
- SLA = Service Level Agreement

Cloud Deployment Models:
	- Public Cloud
		- any one can access
	- Private cloud
		- for people within organization
	- Hybrid cloud
		- combo public + private cloud
		
Cloud / Vendor / Cloud Vendor:
	1. AWS (Amazon Web Service)
	2. Microsoft Azure				--> https://portal.azure.com/
	3. GCP (Google Cloud Platform)
	
Ques - how much amount (approx), I need to pay to run 30 VMs each of 8GB RAM, for 1 month?

BYOL - Bring Your Own Lic



Software for networking:
-----------------------
	- Cisco Packet Tracer
	- GNS3 (Graphical Network Simulator)
	
	
	hub		-> dumb
	switch	-> intelligent 
	
ARP
	- Address Resolution Protocol
	
switch maintains MAC/CAM table

Routing protocol
- OSPF	-> unlimited routers
- RIP	-> 15+1 = 16


ipconfig /release		--> release old IP address
ipconfig /renew			--> get a new IP address

Ques - How an IP is assigned to a computer?
-------------------------------------------
- 3 ways to assign an IP to a computer
	1. Manual (static IP)
		- admin needs to assign IP manually to all the PCs.
		- good for limited number of computers.
		
	2. Automatic 
		- no human intervention is required.
		- automatically IP will be assigned to the system.
		- it is possible because of 
			- DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
			- DHCP works on port 67,68
			- DHCP works on Client-Server architecture.
			- DHCP uses "DORA" process
				D = Discover
				O = Offer
				R = Request
				A = Acknowledgement
					
	3. APIPA
		- Automatic Private IP Addressing
		- when DHCP server is unable to give the IP address, bcoz of:
			1. DHCP server is inactive
			2. DHCP scope is full
		- in this case, client automatically allocates a "specific IP" range to itself. called as APIPA.
		- specific IP range (169.254.X.X) - 169.254.1.1 - 169.254.255.255 
		- with this APIPA address, you cannot communicate with any machine within the network.
		- with this APIPA address, you cannot ping another computer
		- with this APIPA address, you cannot share any data on the network
		- APIPA can be resolved
			1. ensure DHCP server is working fine.
			2. ensure DHCP server has enough IP addresses in scope.
			3. release the IP 	-> ipconfig /release
			4. renew the IP 	-> ipconfig /renew
			5. if nothing works out, set the IP MANUALLY.
