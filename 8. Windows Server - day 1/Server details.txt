Roles
------
	- are made up of role services components that provide additional functionality associated with the role.
	- we need to install the role(s), in order to get the appro. services.

	- Remote access
	- Remote desktop service (RDS)
	
Features:
------------
	- independent components that supports the "Roles" in thier working.
	- are the backbone for the roles.
	- list of features:
		- DotNet 3.5 Framework
		- DotNet 4.5 Framework
		- Bitlocker
		- BITS

Server Manager: (Server Manager Dashboard Page)
----------------
	- is a graphical tool for managing local or remote computers in windows servers
	- what we can do?
		- install/uninstall roles
		- install/uninstall features
		- manage local machine
			- computer name
			- IP address
			- Firewall
			- Clock
		- manage remote computers

Administrative tools:
----------------------
	- Active Directory Administrative Center
	- Active Directory Users & Computers
	- DNS Console
	- Event Viewer
	- Performance Monitor
	- Task Schedular
	- IIS Manager
	- GPMC (Group Policy Management Console)
	
Installation methods:
----------------------
	1. Optical Disk (DVD)
	2. WDS (Windows Deployment Service) - Network boot
	3. USB Media (pendrive)

Windows Active Directory (WAD): or Active Directory (AD)
---------------------------------------------------------
	- is a directory service developed by Microsoft. 
	- linux version of AD is called "LDAP" (Light Weight Directory Access Protocol)
	- it stores all the information like
		- Users
		- Groups
		- Computers
	- it perform 2As
		- Authentication (verify your identity)
		- Authorization  (Granting Permissions)
	- you can manage & control resources
		- network resources
		- Policies
		- User accounts & what they access.
	- to get the AD within your organization, we need to install "ADDS" (Active Directory Domain Service) role on windows server.

Terms used in Active Directory (AD) concept:
--------------------------------------------
Domain
	- logical boundary for administrative purpose.
	- it is a collection of objects
		- users
		- computers
		- groups
	- all the objects shares the same database
		- Name of the domain database is "NTDS.DIT"
			- "New Technology Directory Service.directory"
		- this database is stored with the AD domain.
	- domain is represented as a TRIANGLE.
	
Tree
	- hierarchy of domains with the root domain.
	
Forest
	- collection of AD trees.
	- it shares a common schema (blueprint) & global catalog (indexing)

Schema
	- its the blueprint
	- defines the types of objects created in the directory.

Global catalog
	- a searchable index
	- we search for the objects with the help of GC server.

OU (Organizational Unit)
	- its like a department
	- these are like containers within a domain that holds
		- users
		- computers
		- groups
Site
	- Physical, Geo-Graphical location within domain
	- it contains multiple OUs in it.

Group Policy
	- its a policy that is applied to manage the domain & its objects.
	- its a centrailzed policy to manage
		- users
		- computers
		- permissions
		- security
	- to create, manage & delete a policy we need GPMC (Group Policy Management Console)
	- group policies are applied on OUs.
	
Group Policy hierarchical structure:
	- local group policy
		- this policy is applied on local computer only & impacts only on your computer.
	- site-level group policy
		- these policies are applied on the SITE level.
		- all the computers within specific site are applied with this policy.
	- Domain level group policy
		- domain policies are applied to all users and computers within that domain.
	- Organizational Unit (OU) level group policies
		- these policies are applied onto the whole OU.

Components of an Active Directory (AD)
---------------------------------------
	1. Physical Component
		- Domain Controller (DC)
			- it contains the copy of AD database (NTDS.dit)
		- Data Store
			- the file on each domain controller that stores the AD information.
		- Global Catalog (GC) Server
			- its a server that hosts the read-only copy of all objects within domain for faster search.
		- Read-Only Domain Controller (RODC)
			- its a special type (read-only) of domain controller.
			- this RODC is often used in branch offices.
	
	2. Logical Component
		- Partition
			- its the logical seperation within the NTDS.dit database
			- aka naming contexts
		- Schema
		- Domain
		- Domain Tree
		- Forest
		- Site
		- OU
		
AD DS logon process:
------------------
	1. user provided username & password and it gets authenticated by DC.
	2. DC returns the TGT (Ticket Granting Token).
	3. using this TGT, client applies to login to SVR using WS.
	4. client is then allowed to login to the SVR using the TGT.
	

types of DCs
	1. Domain Controller (DC)
	2. Additional Domain Controller (ADC)
	3. Backup domain controller (BDC)
	4. Read-Only Domain Controller (RODC)
	5. Primary Domain Controller (PDC)

Operations Master:
-------------------
	- aka FSMO (Flexible Single Master Operation)
	- these are the special domain controller tasks/roles
	- 5 types of FSMO roles, that are applied on forest-level & Domain level
	- Roles in FSMO
		1. Forest 
			a. Domain Naming Master
				- checks for the name
			b. Schema Master
				- checks for the blueprint
		2. Domain
			c. RID (Relative IDentifier) master
				- this allocates the blocks of RIDs to different domain controllers within the domain.
					- whenever an object (user, computer or group) is created within a domain env, a unique SID (Security IDentifier) is allocated to this object.
				- the job of RID is to ensure that no 2 objects have same SID.
				- a set of total 500 RIDs are allocated in domain level, at once.
					- SID
						"S-1-5-21-1341496841-55697840-1495310029-1001"
							-> "S-1-5-21" - type of ID
							-> "1341496841-55697840-1495310029" - where the account is stored
							-> "1001" - is RID
			d. PDC (Primary Domain Controller) Emulator
				- it provides the back compatibility with old system
				- it handles the "password change" & account lockouts.
				- it also checks the time on every system within the domain.
				- Every domain has only ONE PDC Emulator.
			e. Infrastructure Master
				- this manages references to the objects in other domain.
				- it is used for cross-domain object reference.
				
				
Post installation configuration  -->  Server Manager Dashboard Page:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
- here, we perform several tasks just after the installation is completed
- tasks like:
	- to set IP address
	- to change the time & time zone
	- configure firewall
	- to change the IE configuration settings
	- to change the remote management settings
	- to change the computer name
	
Task:
======
first finish below tasks
	1. Installation of windows server 2016 completed 
	2. VMWare tools Installation completed 
	3. power off the windows server 2016 (that u just installed)
	4. install another VM, with windows server 2016 datacenter (CORE) edition

THE MOST IMP THING:
===========================
REVISE ALL THE TOPICS, THAT WE STUDIED TILL NOW.
