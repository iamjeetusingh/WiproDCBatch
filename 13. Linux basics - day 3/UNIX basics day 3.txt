		- it starts with "/"
		- it tells linux path from begining till the end.
		- ex:
			- /etc/passwd
	- relative path
		- works around the current location
		- ex:
			- passwd
			
files in user mgmt:
-------------------
	1. /etc/passwd
		- contains user's detailed information in 7 columns
		- here data is seperated using ":"
		- 7 columns are:
			1. login name
			2. password	--> pwd is stored in another file (/etc/shadow)
			3. User ID

				- cmds to change comment:
					1. chfn <username>
					2. usermod -c "" <username>
			6. home directory of that user

				jeetu	-> /home/jeetu
				thor	-> /home/thor
			7. default shell allocated to the user
				default shell	->	/bin/bash
				change it		-> 	chsh <username>, 
									usermod -s "" username
	2. /etc/shadow
		- contains user's password information & policy in 9 columns.
		- here data is seperated using ":"
		- 9 columns are:
			1. login name
			2. true encrypted password
			3. last password change
			4. Minimum password age
			5. Maximum password age
			6. Warning days
			7. Account inactive days

Task
-------
you have to create a user with the following details:
	login name		: rocky
	user id			: 5000
	default shell	: /bin/sh
	comment			: Italian Stallion
NOTE: you cannot use USERMOD command.

SUDO user management:
----------------------
sudo user = regular user ($) + limited root privileges

In windows		|	in Linux
----------------|---------------
Administrator	|	Root
Delegated admin	|	sudo user
Guest users		|	regular user

to work with sudo users:
	1. file - read-only
		# /etc/sudoers
	2. command
		# visudo
		
Visudo:
----------
	1. Give FULL access (equal to ROOT user) to a regular user.
	2. Give pre-defined access (Networking, storage, services).
	3. Give complete CUSTOM access.
	
Task
------
1. Create a user with your last name and make it sudo user with admin privileges (like Networking, Storage, Services & Visudo command)  & verify after you login to this user.

2. Add a group WiproB42 and add 2 users (user1 & user2) and list all the users that are present in the group.

3. Create a directory (/notifications) and provide access of HR and Accounts groups (create if not available) with read & write access for HR & read only access for Accounts team.

Password for a user in linux:
-------------------------------
/etc/shadow
	- contains user's password information & policy in 9 columns.
	- here data is seperated using ":"
	- 9 columns are:
		1. login name
		2. true encrypted password
			a. hashing algo (SHA512, MD5)	--> creating encrypted pwd.
				SHA512	-> $6
				MD5		-> $1
			b. salt text					--> to randomize the password.
			c. text password				--> centos
		3. last password change
			- since 1st jan 1970	-> epoch date
		4. Minimum password age
			0 days	-	imm. change the password
		5. Maximum password age
			99999 days ~> 273yrs	-> 60 days 
		6. Warning days
			- to show the warning (number of days) when pwd expires
		7. Account inactive days
		8. Account expiration
		9. Unused till date/kept for future purpose.
		
Storage Management:
--------------------
file system in linux
	- ext
	- ext2
	- ext3
	- ext4
	- xfs		--> default file system in almost all new linux OS.
	- btrfs
	- cramfs
	- exfat
	
commands for storage in linux:
	- du		--> disk usage
	- lsblk		--> list block files.
	- fdisk		--> for creating, modifying & deleting partition on a HDD.
	- mount		--> used for mounting a file system in linux.
	- umount	--> used for unmounting a file system in linux.
	- df		--> listing the mounted partitions.

HDDs in linux:
----------------
Centos/Redhat		->	/dev/sda(SCSI disk A)
	- one disk	- /dev/sda
		part1	- /dev/sda1
		part2	- /dev/sda2
		part3	- /dev/sda3
	- 2nd disk	- /dev/sdb
	- 3rd disk	- /dev/sdc
Ubuntu				->	/dev/hda(Hard Disk A)

Simple Partition:
-----------------
- creating a new partition in linux OS.
- steps:
	- add a new disk in the VM.
	- reboot your linux machine.
	- create partition using fdisk utility
	- create a file system for this partition
	- create a new mount point for this partition
	- mount this partition
		1. temporary	-> mount
		2. permanent	-> /etc/fstab
	- verify this partition

how to get the disks available within linux machine, without reboot:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
	# ls -l /sys/class/scsi_host/
	# grep mpt /sys/class/scsi_host/host*/proc_name
	# echo "- - -" > /sys/class/scsi_host/host0/scan
