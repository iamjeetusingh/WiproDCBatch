UNIX
-----
	- Linux is derived from UNIX OS
	- UNiplexed Information Computing System (UNICS -> UNIX)
	- release on "1st Jan 1970"
	- earlier (1969, 68..), it was used by big companies, banks, etc..
	- epoch date -> difference of dates between 1st jan 1970 & today.
		11 Feb 2025 -> 20,130 days
	- developed by Dennis Ritchie & Kemp Thomson in AT & T Bell Labs.
	- UNIX is build using "C language".
	
- UNIX is hardware dependent.
	IBM's AIX 	--> IBM's hardware
	HP's HPUX	-->	HP hardware
	
Linux OS
	- was developed by Linus Benedict Torwalds.
	- introduced on 17th Sept 1991
	- linux is derived from UNIX OS
	- linux is hardware independent.
	
Secure
	- SELinux
		- Security Enhanced Linux
		- any request (by user, process, application) that might change the linux kernel is by default denied.

Linux	--> opensource (free to use, free to share, free to download, can change the source code)

UNIX	--> freeware (free to use, free to share, free to download, can not change the source code)


OLD OS:
-------
	- CentOS 3,4,5,6
	- Boot time: 40sec
	- 1st service name: INIT
	
NEW OS:
-------
	- CentOS 7,8,9
	- Boot time: 20sec
	- 1st service name: SYSTEMD
	
Booting process of Linux:
--------------------------
1. Power On the machine
2. control goes to BIOS
	BIOS --> POST test (Power On Self Test)
3. control goes to MBR
	- MBR (master boot record)
	- it has the address of OS
4. control goes to GRUB (GRand Unified Boot loader)
	- shows the list of operating system(s)
	- version: GRUB 2.0
5. kernel
	- it loads the operating system to RAM
	- it starts the 1st process of linux -> SYSTEMD (pid:1) (new OS)
	- it starts the 1st process of linux -> INIT    (pid:1) (old OS)
6. Runlevel
	- the mode in which the OS must be started.
	- there are 7 modes :
		-------------------------------------------------------------------
		   OLD   |    MEANING							|  NEW
		-------------------------------------------------------------------
		- init 0 = shutdown / halt						= poweroff.target
		- init 1 = single maintainence mode				= multi-user.target
		- init 2 = multi-user maintainence mode			= multi-user.target
		- init 3 = fully function CLI mode.				= multi-user.target
		- init 4 = unused till date / future purpose	= multi-user.target
		- init 5 = init 3 + GUI							= graphical.target
		- init 6 = reboot								= reboot.target
		-------------------------------------------------------------------
7. Login screen
	- username 
	- password
	

in windows 	-> folder
in linux	-> directory	

File system Hierarchy Standard(FHS):
=========================================
/(slash, forward slash, root)
	- /bin	= binary directory, contains regular user cmds in it.
	- /sbin	= super binary directory, contains ROOT user cmds in it.
	- /boot = contains all bootable files in it, minimum size = 350MB
	- /home = home directory of regular user
				- /home/sanjey
				- /home/nikitha
				- /home/charan
	- /root	= home directory for ROOT user (there's only ONE root per server).
	- /dev	= contains device related files in it.
				- cd/dvd -> /dev/sr0
				- HDD    -> /dev/sda
	- /mnt	= mount point for devices
				- pendrive -> /mnt/abc
	- /etc	= it contains all the configuration files		
				- firewall
				- user
				- network
				- package
				- password
	- /var	= variable length, it contains LOGS in it.
	- /usr	= user installed apps are present here.
	- /proc = it contains all running processes in it.
	- /tmp	= it contains temporary files & directories in it.
	- /lib 	= its for developers, 32bit architecture
	- /libx64	= its for developers, 64bit architecture
	- /run	= similar to /mnt
	- /opt	= similar to /usr
	
KDump
- Kernel Dumping Mechnaism
- contains the reason the server crash in a small (161MB) space.
